export const constructPrompt = (
  subject: string,
  level: string,
  method: string
) => `Provide a concise overview of key concepts in ${subject} that make up approximately 20% of the field but would allow for an understanding of about 80% of it. Tailor the response to a ${level} level. The context for this information is for ${method}. Provide a few examples of how these concepts apply in real-world contexts.
Format: you will give as a response as JSON object. It will have 3 fields: coveringPoints, pointDetails, realWorld.
In coveringPoints you should outline all points that will be covered in array of strings.
In pointDetails you will create an object with key:value structure, key will be a point name, the value will be the text covering this point.
In realWorld you will create an object with key:value structure, key will be an example of a real-world application title and the value will be the text explanation.

In all key:value pairs both key and value strings should be covered in ""(double-quote mark)`;
